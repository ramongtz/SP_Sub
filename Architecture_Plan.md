Cloud Architecture: SCORM Processor
This plan outlines a secure, scalable, and provider-agnostic architecture for the SCORM Processor tool, designed to be deployed on any major cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) at little to no cost by leveraging free tiers.

Core Principle: Portability via Containerization
The key to being provider-agnostic is Docker. We will package our Python script and all its dependencies into a standard Docker container. This container is a self-contained unit that can run identically on any system that has Docker installed, from a developer's laptop to any cloud provider's infrastructure. This eliminates vendor lock-in.

Architecture Components
1. Frontend (User Interface)
Technology: A simple, static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web page.

Functionality: Provides a clean user interface for logging in, uploading .zip files, selecting the SCORM version (1.2 or 2004), and downloading the processed results.

Deployment: Can be hosted for free on numerous services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any cloud provider's object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) configured for static website hosting.

2. Authentication (Secure & Agnostic)
Technology: Auth0 or Clerk.

Functionality: These are third-party identity platforms that handle user login and security. They are completely independent of any cloud provider.

Cost: Both services offer generous free tiers that are more than sufficient for a small-to-medium-sized team (e.g., thousands of users and logins per month). This is much simpler and cheaper than managing our own authentication server.

3. Backend (The Dockerized Application)
Technology: Our Python script, packaged in a Docker container.

Functionality: This is the processing engine. It will be built as a small web server (using a lightweight Python framework like Flask or FastAPI) that listens for API requests from the frontend.

Deployment (The "Run Anywhere" Part): The Docker container can be deployed to any provider's container service, most of which have substantial free tiers:

AWS: AWS App Runner or AWS Fargate (both have free tiers).

Google Cloud: Google Cloud Run (has a large, perpetual free tier).

Azure: Azure Container Apps.

This gives you the freedom to choose the provider with the best pricing or performance for your needs, and to migrate easily if required.

4. File Storage (The Only Provider-Specific Part)
Technology: Any cloud provider's Object Storage service.

AWS: Simple Storage Service (S3)

Google Cloud: Cloud Storage (GCS)

Azure: Blob Storage

Functionality: This is used for temporary storage. The frontend will get a secure, short-lived URL to upload the user's file directly to a private "uploads" bucket. The backend container then processes the file and places the result in a "processed" bucket, generating a secure download link for the user.

Cost: All major providers offer a free tier for their object storage (e.g., 5GB of storage and thousands of requests per month), which will be more than enough for this application. The backend code will simply use the appropriate SDK (e.g., boto3 for AWS) to interact with the chosen storage service.

Summary of the Agnostic & Free-Tier Stack
Frontend: Static HTML/JS (Free on GitHub Pages/Netlify)

Backend: Docker Container (Free on Cloud Run/App Runner)

Authentication: Auth0/Clerk (Free Tier)

Storage: Cloud Object Storage (Free Tier on AWS/GCP/Azure)

This architecture achieves all your goals: it is not tied to any single provider, it is highly secure, and its operational costs will be $0 as long as usage stays within the generous free tiers of these services.
